    "# Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is a text normalization technique used to prepare text, words, and documents for further processing. In natural language, words are being modified in order to express different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice, aspect, person, number, gender, and mood. In natural language processing and specifically in sentiment analysis it is important to examine the initial meaning of a word together with the frequency the word appears in a text. This technique resolves the problem of having different versions of the same word inside a corpora text by trying to transform words to their common root form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the affected part of the words is the suffix thus most algorithms are simply cutting off some commonly used suffixes like \"s\", \"es\", \"ies\", \"ing\" and etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples of stemming:\n",
    "    - Playing &#8594; play\n",
    "    - Played  &#8594; play\n",
    "    - Plays   &#8594; play\n",

    "### Lancaster Stemmer\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lancaster or Paice-Husk Stemmer was developed by Chris D Paice at Lancaster University and it is considered a very aggressive stemming algorithm at specifying the removal or replacement of an ending.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lancaster stemmer is iterative, and uses just one table of rules; each rule may specify either deletion or replacement of an ending. The rules are grouped into sections corresponding to the final letter of the suffix; this means that the rule table is accessed quickly by looking up the final letter of the current word or truncated word.\n",
    "Within each section the ordering of the rules is significant. Some rules are restricted to intact words, i.e., words from which no ending has yet been removed. A simple blanket acceptability test is applied before any matching rule is activated. After a rule has been applied, processing may be allowed to continue iterafively, or may be terminated. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Lancaster stemming algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspects the final letter of the word, checks for all the rules in the implemented table, if the condition of the examined rule is satisfied (for example the final letter is the letter 's') and the word is not considered intact then the rule applies. The algorithm continues for all the words inside the corpora text.\n",

    "\n",
    "The original algorithm (Porter1) consists of 5 phases of word reduction. Each phase has a set of rules written beneath each other, among which only one is obeyed.\n",
    "First a condition loosely checks the number of syllables to see whether a word is long enough to replace the suffix or not.\n",
    "Next, every rule's condition is checked and if the condition is satisfied the token is getting reformed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, Dr. Porter himself has suggested several improvements to the original algorithm.\n",
    "The changes made are :\n",
    "- Terminating ‘y’ changed to ‘i’ seldom occurrence.\n",
    "- Suffix ‘us’ does not lose its ‘s’.\n",
